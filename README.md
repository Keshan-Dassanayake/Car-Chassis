<h1>Car Chassis</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project features the design of a car chassis optimized for strength, durability, and weight efficiency. Created using SolidWorks, the chassis is designed to support various automotive components while maintaining structural integrity under dynamic loads. It is suitable for applications in motorsports or vehicle prototyping, with a focus on performance, design precision, and manufacturability.</br>

<br>Additionally, the project includes a custom file for weldment profiles, enabling efficient and accurate modeling of the chassis structure to meet specific design requirements.
